It took at least a month before I discovered that he has a razor sharp wit and a dry sense of humour. When it was clear that he liked me I had to twist his arm to ask me out! But he showed his romantic side when he sent me on a treasure hunt that ended with roses and stuffed toys! <3 </p><p>In the last eight years we've graduated, had our OE, had a long distance relationship (because Alex couldn't make up his mind about where to move), and moved all the way to the other side of the world. When he finally asked me to marry him in one of the most scenic destinations, I couldn't have been happier. I can't wait to start spending the rest of my life with him.</p>"

Initially she would hang around in the computer labs generally being distracting but I soon warmed up to her and eventually found myself specifically seeking her out in the labs. I finally took the initiative and made elaborate plans to ask her out. What followed were some of the best eight years of my life, we graduated, travelled and just generally spent time together, but the true highlight was doing all of this with her. </p><p>After a short long distance relationship (because she was reluctant to move to Australia) I finally decided it was time, the location would be Kanazawa in Japan and armed with a ring, my dashing good looks, and some improvised planning I set out to make Nilanthi my wife.</p>"
