#Our wedding website

We are getting married, and this is a site announcing it to the world, and more importantly to the attendees.

##Design
All design was done by my amazing bride. Without her both this site and the wedding day would have not been possible

## Implementation
This project was initially a node.js project but was ported to .NET to make it easier to host. Because of its origins the site makes heavy use of dynamics and partials. There is very little server processing required, once generated the output can be easily cached

Front end styles are based on bootstrap but with custom less to make it our own. A few small jQuery pieces are scattered throughout to get some specialized functionality.
